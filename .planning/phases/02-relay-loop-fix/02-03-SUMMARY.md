# Phase 02-03: Relay Loop Fix Testing Summary

**Comprehensive state machine and debounce tests verify loop prevention guards work correctly**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 27m 11s
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T15:47:32Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T16:14:43Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- State machine lifecycle tests verify IDLE → STABLE → IDLE transitions
- State guard tests confirm selection blocked when not in IDLE state
- Debounce tests verify rapid emissions are batched into single selection
- User action tests confirm manual operations reset state to IDLE

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add state machine lifecycle tests** - `4bbf19a7` (test)
   - Test selectionState starts as IDLE
   - Test transition to STABLE after auto-selection
   - Test return to IDLE after cooldown period

2. **Task 2: Add state guard prevention tests** - `69dafcca` (test)
   - Test auto-select skips when state is not IDLE
   - Test setManualRelay resets state to IDLE
   - Test clearRelay resets state to IDLE
   - Test enableAutoSelect resets state to IDLE

3. **Task 3: Add debounce behavior tests** - `8416ec89` (test)
   - Test rapid emissions are batched by debounce
   - Test processing happens after debounce delay

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/src/test/java/network.columba.app/service/PropagationNodeManagerTest.kt` - Added 9 new test functions covering state machine lifecycle, state guards, and debounce behavior

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified. Plan correctly identified all necessary test scenarios.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed type mismatch in Flow declarations**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (State machine lifecycle tests)
- **Issue:** Used `MutableSharedFlow<List<AnnounceEntity>>` but `getAnnouncesByTypes` returns `Flow<List<Announce>>` (domain model, not entity)
- **Fix:** Changed to `MutableSharedFlow<List<network.columba.app.data.repository.Announce>>`
- **Files modified:** app/src/test/java/network.columba.app/service/PropagationNodeManagerTest.kt
- **Verification:** Tests compile and pass
- **Committed in:** 4bbf19a7 (Task 1 commit)

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed corrupted KSP cache**
- **Found during:** Task 1 verification
- **Issue:** `Storage corrupted /home/tyler/repos/public/columba/app/build/kspCaches/debug/symbolLookups/lookups.tab_i`
- **Fix:** Ran `./gradlew clean` to clear corrupted build artifacts
- **Files modified:** None (build directory)
- **Verification:** Subsequent builds succeeded
- **Committed in:** N/A (build environment fix)

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (2 blocking issues)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes necessary for compilation. No scope changes.

## Issues Encountered

**Build cache corruption:** Initial compilation failed with corrupted KSP storage. Resolved with `./gradlew clean`. This is a known Gradle/KSP issue that occasionally occurs and requires cache invalidation.

**Type system clarification:** The plan referenced `AnnounceEntity` but the repository actually returns the `Announce` domain model. This distinction is important because Room entities are converted to domain models at the repository boundary. Tests now correctly use the domain model type.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Testing coverage complete for relay selection state machine:**
- State transitions verified (IDLE → SELECTING → STABLE → IDLE)
- State guards prevent re-entrant selection (issue #343 root cause)
- Debounce batches rapid Room invalidations (reduces unnecessary processing)
- User actions correctly cancel auto-selection

**Ready for integration:**
- All PropagationNodeManager tests passing (32 tests total)
- No regressions in existing test suite
- State machine behavior fully verified via automated tests

**Remaining work in Phase 02:**
- Plan 02-02 needs execution (Sentry breadcrumbs for relay selection observability)

**Confidence level:** High - comprehensive test coverage verifies the state machine implementation from 02-01 prevents the relay selection loop reported in #343.
