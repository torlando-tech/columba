# RNS 1.1.3 with socket leak fix and RPC exception handling
# Fork patches:
# - TCPInterface/BackboneInterface: Close socket on connection failure
#   to prevent resource leak (~780 leaked sockets/hour during reconnects)
# - Link.py: Catch exceptions in __update_phy_stats() to prevent crashes
#   when connecting to shared instance with mismatched RPC keys

# LXMF from fork with external stamp generator + receiving interface capture
# Patches:
#   - set_external_generator() to bypass Python multiprocessing on Android
#   - Pass receiving_interface to delivery callback for opportunistic messages

# LXST for voice calls over Reticulum
# NOTE: pycodec2 is removed from LXST's dependencies and installed via pre-built
# wheel in build.gradle.kts. audioop is built-in on Python 3.11.
# LXST is installed via build.gradle.kts pip block with local wheel containing
# native filterlib .so files for Android (similar to pycodec2)
