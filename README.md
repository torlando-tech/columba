## About Reticulum

[Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum) is a networking stack that lets devices communicate directly with each other, forming resilient mesh networks. It is optimized for low bandwidth, high latency connections, and can communicate over nearly any medium. Columba uses [LXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/LXMF) (Lightweight Extensible Message Format) to send messages across the Reticulum network, and uses a native Android implementation of [ble-reticulum](https://github.com/torlando-tech/ble-reticulum) to enable messaging over BLE with other Android and Linux devices.

## Why "Columba"

Columba, latin for "dove," is a [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba_(constellation)) in the southern sky depicting a dove. Doves are commonly a symbol of peace and hope, and have been used as messengers throughout history.
