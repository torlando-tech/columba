/**
 * Static capability snapshot published by [ChaquopyRnsBackend]'s
 * `capabilities` StateFlow.
 *
 * The capability deltas vs. the kotlin backend ([NATIVE_CAPABILITIES]):
 *
 * - **`hotReloadInterfaces = true`** — RNS 1.5.5 adds a live interface
 *   attach/detach/reload API (`Reticulum.attach_interface` /
 *   `detach_interface` / `reload_interface`), and `PythonRnsTransportAdmin`
 *   now drives it directly for add / edit / enable / disable changes, so the
 *   Python backend applies interface changes live just like the kotlin
 *   backend (no "Apply & Restart" dialog). A single changed interface is
 *   reloaded without touching the rest; if a live reload fails the backend
 *   falls back to the existing full-restart path as a safety net.
 * - **`batteryProfileTuning = UNSUPPORTED`** — the BLE-scan / multicast-lock
 *   / AutoInterface aggressiveness tuning lives in reticulum-kt. The Python
 *   stack has no equivalent runtime knob; the UI replaces the battery
 *   profile picker with a notice pointing at Android's battery settings.
 * - **`collectorHostMode = FULL`** — telemetry collector host mode is the
 *   *well-tested reference path*. `release/v0.10.x` shipped it with upstream
 *   LXMF doing the FIELD_TELEMETRY_STREAM encoding; the slim-Python design
 *   preserves that by having `PythonRnsTelemetry` call upstream LXMF
 *   directly. (It is the kotlin backend's lxmf-kt reimplementation that is
 *   [Support.EXPERIMENTAL] pending the A.11 parity test — not this one.)
 * - **`sharedInstanceAvailabilityChecks = true`** — upstream RNS can probe
 *   for a co-located shared `rnsd` instance.
 * - **`shareInstanceHosting = true`** — upstream Python RNS implements the
 *   `SharedInstanceServer` (RPC over TCP 37428) that lets other apps on the
 *   device route through this Reticulum instance. Toggling `share_instance =
 *   yes` in the rendered config promotes the daemon to master (or quietly
 *   yields to a co-located master per upstream's first-to-bind policy). UI
 *   exposes the toggle in Settings → Advanced on this backend only.
 * - **`autoconnectIfacOnlyFilter = false`** — upstream Python RNS has no
 *   knob that filters auto-connect by IFAC presence; reticulum-kt does. UI
 *   hides the IFAC-only Switch on this backend so the toggle doesn't
 *   silently lie about its runtime effect. Implementing the filter on the
 *   Python flavor needs a Columba-authored wrapper around
 *   `RNS.Discovery.autoconnect()` in `event_bridge.py` (slim-Python rule —
 *   no `rns_*.py` facade); tracked as a post-release follow-up.
