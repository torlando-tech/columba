<objective>
Change StateFlow sharing strategy from Eagerly to WhileSubscribed(5000L) for three relay-related StateFlows in PropagationNodeManager

Purpose: The v0.7.3 fix addressed the symptom (rapid re-selection via state machine) but not the root cause: SharingStarted.Eagerly keeps Room database observation active indefinitely, causing continuous reactive churn that triggers edge cases the state machine guard doesn't fully prevent. WhileSubscribed stops upstream collection when no UI observers are present.

Output: PropagationNodeManager with lifecycle-aware StateFlow sharing that eliminates unnecessary database observation during background operation

  <name>Task 1: Update StateFlow sharing strategy to WhileSubscribed</name>
  <files>app/src/main/java/com/lxmf/messenger/service/PropagationNodeManager.kt</files>
  <action>
Change three StateFlow declarations from SharingStarted.Eagerly to SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000L):

1. **currentRelayState** (around line 202):
   - Change: `.stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, RelayLoadState.Loading)`
   - To: `.stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000L), RelayLoadState.Loading)`

2. **currentRelay** (around line 212):
   - Change: `.stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, null)`
   - To: `.stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000L), null)`

3. **availableRelaysState** (around line 236):
   - Change: `.stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, AvailableRelaysState.Loading)`
   - To: `.stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000L), AvailableRelaysState.Loading)`

The 5000L timeout (5 seconds) is the standard Android recommendation - it survives configuration changes (screen rotation typically &lt;2 seconds) without restarting upstream unnecessarily.

DO NOT modify:
- The state machine (IDLE/SELECTING/STABLE/BACKING_OFF) - remains as defense-in-depth
- The debounce(1000) on the announce Flow - still valuable for batching
- The loop detection with recordSelection() - still valuable for edge cases
- The 30-second cooldown after selection - still valuable for stability

  <name>Task 2: Verify build and existing tests pass</name>
  <files>app/src/main/java/com/lxmf/messenger/service/PropagationNodeManager.kt</files>
  <action>
Run the project build and PropagationNodeManager tests to verify the change doesn't break existing functionality.

1. Build the project to verify no compilation errors
2. Run PropagationNodeManager unit tests to verify state machine behavior is unchanged

The existing tests use mocked StateFlows in the test setup, so they don't directly test the SharingStarted strategy. However, they verify the core state machine logic remains intact.

  <name>Task 3: Verify loop detection instrumentation intact</name>
  <files>app/src/main/java/com/lxmf/messenger/service/PropagationNodeManager.kt</files>
  <action>
Confirm that the loop detection mechanism (from Phase 2) remains intact. This is critical because:
- The Sentry logging is how we verify RELAY-03-B (no add/remove/add cycles)
- The 48-hour zero-warning metric (RELAY-03-C) depends on this instrumentation

Verify the following code exists in PropagationNodeManager.kt:
1. `recordSelection()` function that tracks selection timestamps
2. `recentCount >= 3` threshold check that triggers warning
3. `Sentry.captureMessage("Relay selection loop detected: $recentCount selections in 60s", SentryLevel.WARNING)` call

DO NOT modify this code - just verify it's present.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "Relay selection loop detected" app/src/main/java/com/lxmf/messenger/service/PropagationNodeManager.kt`
Expected: 1 match showing Sentry.captureMessage call (line ~841)

Expected: Multiple matches showing the function definition and calls
  </verify>
  <done>
- Loop detection with Sentry logging confirmed present
- recordSelection() function confirmed present
- Instrumentation is ready to report loops if they occur post-deployment

After completing all tasks:

1. **Code verification:**
   - `grep -c "WhileSubscribed(5000L)" app/src/main/java/com/lxmf/messenger/service/PropagationNodeManager.kt` returns 3
   - `grep -c "SharingStarted.Eagerly" app/src/main/java/com/lxmf/messenger/service/PropagationNodeManager.kt` returns 0

2. **Build verification:**
   - Project compiles without errors
   - PropagationNodeManager unit tests pass

3. **Pattern verification:**
   - State machine (IDLE/SELECTING/STABLE/BACKING_OFF) unchanged
   - debounce(1000) on announce Flow unchanged
   - Loop detection with recordSelection unchanged

4. **Instrumentation verification:**
   - Loop detection logging still in place (Sentry.captureMessage for "Relay selection loop detected")
   - This enables post-deployment monitoring per RELAY-03-C

<success_criteria>
Pre-deployment (verified by this plan):
- [ ] Three StateFlows changed from Eagerly to WhileSubscribed(5000L)
- [ ] Zero instances of SharingStarted.Eagerly in PropagationNodeManager
- [ ] Build succeeds with no compilation errors
- [ ] All PropagationNodeManager unit tests pass
- [ ] Phase 2 defense-in-depth mechanisms preserved (state machine, debounce, loop detection)
- [ ] Loop detection Sentry instrumentation confirmed present

Post-deployment (verified via Sentry monitoring after release):
- [ ] Zero "Relay selection loop detected" warnings in Sentry for 48 hours (RELAY-03-C)

Note: The 48-hour Sentry metric is inherently a post-deployment verification. The fix is based on Seer's (Sentry AI) recommendation, validated against Android best practices in 04-RESEARCH.md. Production monitoring is the definitive test - if loops persist after this change, the Research document's "Open Questions" section outlines further investigation paths.
