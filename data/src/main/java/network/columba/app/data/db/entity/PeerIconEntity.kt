/**
 * Entity for storing peer icon appearances received via LXMF messages.
 *
 * Icons are transmitted in LXMF Field 4 (FIELD_ICON_APPEARANCE) and represent
 * the user's chosen visual identity. This is separate from announces (Reticulum
 * network discovery) - icons are an LXMF-layer concept.
 *
 * This table is the single source of truth for peer icons and is joined
 * by conversations, announces, and contacts queries to display icons consistently.
