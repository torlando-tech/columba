## Milestone Summary

**v0.10.0 Voice Messages**

| Phase | Goal | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 7. Protocol Foundation | Audio round-trips through LXMF pipeline | PROTO-01..05 | **COMPLETE** |

| 9. Playback Polish | Unplayed indicator, single-playback, Oboe output | PLAY-05..07 EDGE-02 | **COMPLETE** |
| 10. UI Polish + Edge Cases | Slide-to-cancel, mic/send swap, interruptions | REC-02,03 EDGE-03..05 | In progress (10-01 done) |

## Accumulated Context

### From Previous Milestones

- LXST-kt audio library already in codebase (Opus, Codec2, Oboe capture/playback)
- FIELD_AUDIO = 0x07 already defined in Python wrapper
- MessageEntity.fieldsJson already supports audio field storage
- Image attachment pipeline (FIELD_IMAGE) is the closest pattern to follow

### Phase 7 Delivered

- **07-01:** LXMF transport pipeline -- audioData/audioCodecId through full IPC stack (Kotlin -> AIDL -> ServiceBinder -> Python -> FIELD_AUDIO)
- **07-02:** Kotlin extraction -- MessageUi audio fields, MessageMapper.extractAudioBytes/extractAudioMetadata/hasAudioField, AudioMetadata data class
- **07-03:** ViewModel send flow -- buildFieldsJson Field 7 packing, sendMessage audio pass-through, handleSendSuccess local storage, retryFailedMessage re-extraction

### Phase 8 Delivered

- **08-01:** VoiceMessageRecorder (AudioRecord 24kHz mono + Opus VOICE_MEDIUM encoding + length-prefixed frame accumulation + 300ms discard + 30s auto-stop + audio focus + waveform peaks) and AudioPermissionManager (RECORD_AUDIO check)
- **08-02:** VoiceMessageViewModel + VoiceMessagePlayer + full UI integration:
  - Hold-to-record mic button (Box + pointerInput + detectTapGestures, NOT IconButton)
  - Recording indicator (pulsing red dot + timer replacing text field)
  - Preview bar with playback, waveform visualization, trash/send controls
  - VoiceMessagePlayer (Opus decode + AudioTrack MODE_STATIC + progress polling)
  - VoiceMessageBubble (inline audio bubble with play/pause, waveform, duration)
  - Voice-only text suppression (hides " " content for voice-only messages)
  - Shared WaveformBar composable with progress coloring
  - sendMessage wiring with audio bytes, codec ID, waveform peaks

### Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Opus VOICE_MEDIUM (8kbps) | Balances quality and mesh-friendly size (~30KB/30s) | 7 |
| AudioRecord + Opus.encode() over NativeCaptureEngine | Avoids singleton conflict with voice calls; quality diff negligible for store-and-forward | 8 |
| Length-prefixed Opus frames (no Ogg container) | Compact, simple, sufficient for Columba-to-Columba; codec_id identifies format | 7 |
| 30s max duration | Keeps messages under ~30KB, practical for mesh links | 8 |
| Audio detected by JSONArray format in field 7 | Distinguishes audio ["codec_id","hex"] from legacy location string data in same field | 7-02 |
| audioDurationMs=null until Phase 9 playback | Duration in audio header requires decoding; deferred to avoid blocking toMessageUi() | 7-02 |
| Waveform not transmitted over wire for received messages | Avoids bloating LXMF wire format; computed lazily on first view in Phase 9 | 7-02 |
| audioDataPath added to AIDL alongside audioData | Large audio files bypass Android Binder 1MB IPC limit via temp file path, same as imageDataPath pattern | 7-01 |
| Field 7 disambiguation via isinstance on first element | list[0] is str = audio, bytes/str = legacy location JSON; no ambiguity possible | 7-01 |
| Audio focus released before 300ms discard check | Ensures tap-discards release focus; prevents permanently muting other apps | 8-01 |
| Partial final frames discarded (not zero-padded) | Avoids audible silence artifacts at recording end | 8-01 |
| Both API 26+ and deprecated audio focus paths | minSdk is 24; need deprecated requestAudioFocus for pre-O devices | 8-01 |
| VoiceRecording.equals uses contentEquals for ByteArray | Standard Kotlin data class pattern for array fields | 8-01 |
| Box + pointerInput over IconButton for mic button | IconButton's internal clickable modifier consumes touch events before child pointerInput can detect them | 8-02 |
| Mic button visibility independent of isRecording | Composable hosting tryAwaitRelease() MUST remain in composition tree for entire gesture; conditional removal kills the coroutine | 8-02 |
| Preview-before-send (not auto-send on release) | User requested confirmation flow; REC-09 promoted from v2 to v1 | 8-02 |
| VoiceMessagePlayer as standalone class (not ViewModel) | Used in both VoicePreviewBar (raw bytes) and VoiceMessageBubble (fieldsJson bytes); remember{} in each composable | 8-02 |
| AudioTrack MODE_STATIC for playback | Voice messages are short (<30s); decode all frames up front, write once, track progress via playbackHeadPosition | 8-02 |
| Voice-only messages use " " (space) as content | Sideband requires non-empty field 0; suppressed in UI via isBlank() check | 8-02 |

### Pending Todos

3 todos in `.planning/todos/pending/`:
- **Investigate native memory growth using Python profiling** (HIGH priority)
- **Make discovered interfaces page event-driven** (ui)
- **Refactor PropagationNodeManager to extract components** (architecture)

### Phase 9 Delivered

- **09-01:** voicePlayed persistence layer -- Room schema v43, MessageEntity column, domain Message field, MessageDao.markVoicePlayed(), ConversationRepository.markVoicePlayed()
- **09-02:** VoiceMessagePlayer rewrite -- NativePlaybackEngine (Oboe) replaces AudioTrack; messageId tracking; savedPositions for resume; AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT; countOpusFrames() duration extraction in MessageMapper; VoiceMessageBubble now shows correct duration without playback
- **09-03:** Unplayed indicator UI -- voicePlayed in MessageUi/MessageMapper; shared VoiceMessagePlayer in MessagingViewModel (lazy, onCleared cleanup); blue dot + accent waveform for unplayed received messages; off-screen audio continuity (no per-bubble player)

### Decisions (Phase 9)

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| @ColumnInfo(defaultValue = "0") on voicePlayed entity field | Must match INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 in migration SQL for Room schema validation | 9-01 |
| No DEFAULT NULL in voicePlayed migration | Follows project Room gotcha: DEFAULT NULL creates schema mismatch with Kotlin nullable field defaultValue annotation | 9-01 |
| voicePlayed defaults false for all messages | Non-voice messages are never "played" so indicator never shows; voice messages start unplayed until explicitly marked | 9-01 |
| List<FloatArray> (per-frame) instead of flat FloatArray for decoded frames | Required for position-indexed playback starting from saved frame index | 9-02 |
| getCallbackFrameCount() for progress (not getBufferedFrameCount) | Callback count reflects frames actually rendered to speaker; buffered count is ring buffer backlog | 9-02 |
| AudioTrack MODE_STATIC replaced by NativePlaybackEngine (Oboe) | Low-latency SPSC ring buffer; consistent with telephony infrastructure; required by PLAY-07 | 9-02 |
| countOpusFrames() walks hex wire format directly | No ByteArray allocation needed for a counting operation; fast enough for toMessageUi() call path | 9-02 |
| Shared VoiceMessagePlayer in ViewModel (not CompositionLocal/singleton) | ViewModel lifecycle ties cleanup to screen exit; onCleared() stops player and releases Oboe engine | 9-03 |
| voicePlayer nullable in MessageBubble (default null) | Allows MessageBubble usage in previews/tests without real player; voice bubble only renders when player non-null | 9-03 |
| onVoicePlay accepts fieldsJson (not audioBytes) | Deferred IO extraction in scope.launch+withContext(IO) inside MessagingScreen; keeps MessageBubble coroutine-free | 9-03 |

### Phase 10 Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| AnimatedVisibility wraps send button only; mic stays in plain if | Mic button hosts tryAwaitRelease() — must remain in composition tree during recording gesture | 10-01 |
| Slide gesture on recording indicator Box, not mic button Box | Mic button uses detectTapGestures; separate sibling element avoids gesture conflict | 10-01 |
| spring(DampingRatioMediumBouncy) for slide snap-back | Natural bouncy feel when finger releases without crossing cancel threshold | 10-01 |
| cancelThresholdPx = screenWidthDp / 3 | Standard ratio for slide-to-cancel in messaging UIs | 10-01 |

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
