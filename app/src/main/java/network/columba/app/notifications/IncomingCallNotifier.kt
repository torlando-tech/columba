/**
 * Narrow port for presenting and cancelling the incoming-call notification.
 *
 * The presentation policy (when the full-screen-intent notification is posted,
 * which caller name it carries) lives on the app side of the backend seam
 * ([network.columba.app.service.IncomingCallPresenter]); this port keeps that
 * policy testable without Android notification machinery.
 *
 * The ongoing-call notification is deliberately *not* part of this port: it is
 * posted by the `:reticulum` service as its foreground notification, because a
 * CallStyle call notification must be enqueued through `startForeground` to be
 * accepted by the platform.
