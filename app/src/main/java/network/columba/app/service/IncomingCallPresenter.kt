/**
 * Process-lifetime presenter for background incoming-call presentation in the main
 * app process.
 *
 * Since the dual-backend architecture, the call observable surface lives on
 * [RnsTelephony] (rns-api); each backend (Python or native Kotlin) republishes
 * [CallState] into the UI process across the AIDL seam. The ringing itself is owned
 * by the :reticulum service process, so this presenter is the app-process consumer
 * that owns presentation when no app UI is visible: on [CallState.Incoming] it
 * resolves the caller display name and posts the high-importance category-call
 * notification with a full-screen intent (see
 * [IncomingCallNotifier.showIncomingCallNotification]), which brings
 * [network.columba.app.IncomingCallActivity] over the lock screen or over whatever
 * app is in the foreground. Any other state cancels the notification.
 *
 * The presenter is the single writer of the incoming-call notification: one post
 * per incoming call, made after the caller-name lookup (a repository read of a few
 * milliseconds, which keeps the full-screen UI's name accurate without delaying
 * takeover by more than a lookup). There is deliberately no asynchronous
 * "name correction" post: a second, out-of-band writer would have to coordinate
 * with every component that cancels the notification (MainActivity, the call
 * screen, user actions) and could resurrect a dismissed notification.
 *
 * Ownership with the foreground UI: while MainActivity is visible it presents the
 * call in-app, so the presenter checks [MainActivityVisibility] before the lookup
 * (skip work the main UI will do) and posts through
 * [MainActivityVisibility.postWhileBackground] after it: the flag check and the
 * post execute as one main-thread sequence (single-thread confinement, no
 * locking), atomic against MainActivity's claim (flag flip plus its cancel).
 * Either the claim wins (this post is skipped) or the post wins (the claim's
 * cancel removes it); no interleaving leaves a background post outliving the
 * foreground takeover.
 *
 * Releasing: when MainActivity stops being visible while a call is still
 * [CallState.Incoming] - the user backgrounded the app mid-ring (home gesture,
 * recents, notification shade takeover), so no new [CallState] emission will
 * ever arrive - the presenter takes presentation back and posts the background
 * notification. Without this, the in-app path that skipped the post leaves the
 * ringing call with no answer/decline UI until the app is reopened. A
 * same-instant reopen (release then immediate claim) races against the lookup
 * and the atomic post, so the presenter loses cleanly to the foreground.
 * Configuration-change stops (rotation) never release ownership
 * ([MainActivityVisibility.releaseForeground]), so this recovery cannot flash
 * the notification mid-rotation.
 *
 * Known, accepted residual: if the call is answered and the same peer calls again
 * while the name lookup is still in flight, the post carries that lookup's result
 * for the new call. The display name is a function of the identity hash (the same
 * database rows), so the presented name is the right name for the ringing call.
 * A second accepted residual: a foreground release and a fresh [CallState.Incoming]
 * emission can both drive a presentation for the same call; the notification
 * helper re-`notify`s the same notification id, so the platform collapses the
 * duplicate into one update.
