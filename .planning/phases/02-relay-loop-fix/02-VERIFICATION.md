# Phase 2: Relay Loop Fix Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Relay auto-selection works correctly without add/remove cycling
**Verified:** 2026-01-25T16:27:59Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User sees relay selected once and it stays selected (no repeated add/remove in logs) | ✓ VERIFIED | State machine with IDLE/SELECTING/STABLE states + 30s cooldown prevents re-entrant selection. State guard at line 843: `if (_selectionState.value != RelaySelectionState.IDLE) return@collect` |
| 2 | User can manually unset relay, and system re-selects exactly once (not in a loop) | ✓ VERIFIED | clearRelay() resets state to IDLE (line 634), enableAutoSelect() triggers single selection with recordSelection call (line 620) |
| 3 | Relay selection logs show clean single-selection behavior, not 40+ cycles | ✓ VERIFIED | Loop detection tracks selections, triggers BACKING_OFF after 3 in 60s with exponential backoff (lines 768-833) |

**Requirements Score:** 2/2 satisfied

### Anti-Patterns Found

**None** — No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments, no empty implementations, no stub patterns detected.

### Human Verification Required

The state machine implementation is complete and verified programmatically, but the actual relay selection behavior requires real-world testing with a live Reticulum network:

#### 1. Single Selection on Startup

**Test:** Deploy app to device with Reticulum network active and auto-select enabled. Observe logcat for relay selection.

**Expected:** 
- Logs show "Relay selection started (state=SELECTING)" exactly once
- Followed by "Relay selection complete (state=STABLE), cooldown=30000ms"
- No repeated "Auto-selecting nearest relay" messages
- No add/remove/add cycles in logs

**Why human:** Requires live Reticulum network to receive propagation node announces and trigger selection logic.

#### 2. Cooldown Period Stability

**Test:** After relay selected, keep app running for 60+ seconds. Monitor logs and relay status.

**Expected:**
- Relay remains selected throughout cooldown period
- Log shows "Relay selection cooldown complete (state=IDLE)" after 30 seconds
- No unexpected re-selection unless relay becomes unavailable
- If new announces arrive during cooldown, logs show "Skipping auto-select - state=STABLE"

**Why human:** Timing-based behavior requires real-time observation over extended period with live network events.

#### 3. Manual Unset and Re-selection

**Test:** With relay selected, manually unset relay (clear or disable auto-select, then re-enable). Observe selection behavior.

**Expected:**
- clearRelay() logs "Clearing relay selection"
- enableAutoSelect() triggers single selection: "Relay selection started (state=SELECTING)"
- Clean transition to STABLE, no loop
- recordSelection logs show reason: "auto-select-enabled"

**Why human:** Requires manual user interaction with live app UI to trigger user action flows.

#### 4. Loop Detection Edge Case

**Test:** Simulate rapid relay cycling (if possible through network conditions or manual intervention).

**Expected:**
- After 3 selections in 60 seconds, log shows "⚠️ Relay loop detected! 3 selections in 60s"
- State transitions to BACKING_OFF
- Exponential backoff: "Entering backoff for Xs (exponent=N)"
- Sentry event captured (check Sentry dashboard)
- After backoff, returns to IDLE and can select again

**Why human:** Difficult to reproduce programmatically, requires specific network conditions or manual triggering.

## Verification Summary

**All automated checks passed:**
- ✅ State machine enum exists with all 4 states (IDLE, SELECTING, STABLE, BACKING_OFF)
- ✅ State guard prevents re-entrant selection logic
- ✅ debounce(1000) batches rapid Flow emissions
- ✅ 30-second cooldown prevents rapid re-selection
- ✅ Loop detection tracks selections and triggers exponential backoff
- ✅ Sentry integration sends warning events when loop detected
- ✅ User actions (setManualRelay, clearRelay, enableAutoSelect) reset state to IDLE
- ✅ All selection paths call recordSelection() with reason
- ✅ Unit tests verify state machine lifecycle, guards, and debounce
- ✅ Project compiles successfully (BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
- ✅ No anti-patterns (TODO/FIXME/placeholders) found

**Human verification required to confirm:**
- Live relay selection behavior with real Reticulum network
- Timing-based cooldown and backoff behavior over extended periods
- User interaction flows (manual selection, unset, re-enable)
- Loop detection edge case behavior

**Confidence level:** High — Implementation is complete and correct according to all plans. The state machine architecture is sound and unit tests provide comprehensive coverage. However, the actual relay loop issue from #343 can only be confirmed fixed through device testing with live network conditions.
